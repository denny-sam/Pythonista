This repository contains my experiments with Python. 

#####1) Website crawler to access particular data
This is a program which goes to www.thenewboston.com and accesses the points earned by each user, displaying it with the usernames. Currently it accesses 40 people's profile points.

#####2) Youtube Playlist length calculator
Using this program you can calculate the length of any Youtube playlist. It takes the URL of the Youtube playlist as command line argument and displays the length in the form of hours, minutes and seconds.
